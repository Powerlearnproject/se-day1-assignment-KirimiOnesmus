#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic way of developing systems and ensuring that they are well-maintained. It involves design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Software engineering has played a major role in the modern world where it has enabled the development of systems used in, the health sector, entertainment, business, and last but not least communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Evolution of high-level programming languages which abstracted high levels of complexity making programming more accessible and efficient which increased productivity and helped develop more complex software.
2. Emerges of structured programming. This improved code readability, maintainability, and fewer errors. This involved the introduction of OOP models and programming.
3. Introduction of Agile methodologies.  Agile transformed how software was developed by promoting continuous feedback, adaptability, and a focus on customer needs. It became the dominant software development methodology, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Gathering: This involves gathering and learning client/user requirements and what they want.
2. Designing and Analysis: This involves developing high-level and detailed designs about the architecture of the software according to the user's requirements.
3. Development: This is where the implementation of the idea is made. It involves coding and writing functions.
4. Testing: This involves several kinds of testing, such as beta testing and integration testing. This is done to avoid errors and make changes before the next phase.
5. Deployment: This is where the software is released to the user to get their feedback and put it into practice.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies involve a systematic way of developing systems from stage to stage. This ensures that one stage is complete before moving to the next phase. While in agile methodology is an iterative model of development that is more flexible compared to waterfall. With the Agile model, the system can be released to the user, and changes made as time goes by and in the waterfall, the system is released when all the phases are complete.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: These are individuals who develop and maintain the software or the system. They write the code according to the requirements, fix bugs, review the code, and integrate the software.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: They are individuals who ensure the system and software meet the quality standards before being rolled to the users. They design and execute test plans and cases, identify bugs report the issues, and ensure that the user's requirements are met.
3. Project managers: They are individuals who oversee, plan, execute, and deliver the software project. They coordinate communication between developers and stakeholders and create and manage project timelines and budgets.
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments(IDEs): These software suites provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples involve Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Version Control Systems(VCS): These are systems that are used to track any changes done to software and coordinate teamwork. Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced in software engineering involve:
1. Deadline: The deadline to deliver the  system  might be tight and demanding to the engineer which makes it difficult to deliver it leading to rush delivery to overcome tough deadlines the team should ensure that there is effective communication between them and stakeholders to help them understand the phase the system undergoes.
2. Change of user requirements: This is another challenge met by engineers during development where the user makes changes in their requirements which might overall affect the software deliverance and timeline: To overcome this challenge there must be communication now and then so that their changes are made in time or stick to the initial plan and use agile methods to develop the software.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components or functions of the software, typically by the developer who wrote the code. This testing ensures that bugs are caught at the earliest stage, making them cheaper and easier to fix.
2. Integration Testing: This tests the interactions between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together as expected. This test ensures that combined modules work together, reducing the risk of issues in the integrated application.
3. System testing: This involves testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This test ensures the software’s overall functionality and reliability, ensuring that all components work together as intended.
4. Acceptance testing: This is a test that is done to ensure that the system meets the user's requirements and is ready. The test validates that the software meets user needs and business requirements, ensuring it’s ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the writing of questions and statements that ensure that the AI model gives the best response possible. This kind of engineering ensures that the question and precise and clear which makes it easy for the model to give the best response possible.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt-Write me an HTML code that helps me develop a form to  submit my details.
Improved prompt: Provide HTML code for a form with fields for name, email, phone number, and a submit button. Ensure the form is styled with basic CSS and has validation for required fields.
The improved prompt gives the fields of the form that I need in my form and ensures that the form has some styling that might be important to my form.
